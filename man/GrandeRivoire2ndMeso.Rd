\title{Dataset: Refitting relationships between bone and lithic fragments from the Grande Rivoire site, Second Mesolithic levels}
\description{
   Grande Rivoire is a Mesolithic rock shelter located in France. This dataset describes the refitting 'connection' relationships between bone and lithic fragments found during excavations of the Second Mesolithic levels. Connection relationship refers to physical connection between two fragments that were part of the same object. 
    
    The dataset is composed of two tables:
    \itemize{
        \item\code{grande.rivoire.2m.connection}: connection relationships between fragments.
        \item\code{grande.rivoire.2m.fragments}: information about the fragments.
    }
}
\usage{data(GrandeRivoire2ndMeso)}
\format{
    \itemize{
        \item\code{grande.rivoire.2m.connection} is a 278x2 matrix. Each line describes a connection relationship between two fragments. Their unique identifiers are given in column 'id1' and in column 'id2', respectively. 
        \item\code{grande.rivoire.2m.fragments} is a 438x4 data frame:
        \itemize{
            \item id: fragment unique identifier 
            \item layer: archaeological layer where the fragment was found
            \item layer.su: combination of the archaeological layer and sedimentary unit where the fragment was found
            \item sector: site sector where the fragment was found
        }
    }
