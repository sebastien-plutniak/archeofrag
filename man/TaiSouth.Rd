\title{Dataset: Refitting relationships between pottery fragments from the Tai site, South entrance sector}
\description{
    The Tai is a Neolithic archaeological site in France. Three sectors were distinguished: the North entrance, the South entrance and the Cave. This dataset regards the refitting 'connection' relationships between pottery fragments found during excavations led by Claire Manen in the South entrance sector. A connection relationship refers to a physical connection between two fragments that were part of the same object. 
    
    The dataset includes two tables:
    \itemize{
        \item\code{tai.south.connection}: connection relationships between fragments.
        \item\code{tai.south.fragments}: information about the fragments.
    }
}
\usage{data(TaiSouth)}
\format{
    \itemize{
        \item\code{tai.south.connection} is a 79x2 matrix. Each line describes a connection relationship between two fragments. Their unique identifiers are given in column 'id1' and in column 'id2', respectively. 
        \item\code{tai.south.fragments} is 82x7 data frame:
        \itemize{
            \item id:  fragment unique identifier 
            \item layer:   stratigraphic layer
            \item sherd_size: size class of the pottery sherd (nb: the numeric value is not metrical)
            \item sherd_thickness: thickness of the pottery sherd in millimeter
            \item x: x coordinates of the location where the pottery sherd was found (in centimetres)
            \item y: y coordinates of the location where the pottery sherd was found (in centimetres)
            \item z: z coordinates of the location where the pottery sherd was found (in centimetres)
        }
    }
