\title{Dataset: Refitting relationships between pottery fragments from the Tai site}
\description{
<<<<<<< HEAD
    The Tai is a Neolithic archaeological site in France. Three sectors were distinguished: the North entrance ('porche nord'), the South entrance ('porche sud') and the Cave ('grotte').  This dataset describes the refitting 'connection' relationships between pottery fragments found during excavations  by Claire Manen. Connection relationship refers to physical connection between two fragments that were part of the same object.

    The dataset is composed of two tables:
    \itemize{
        \item\code{tai.connection}: 'connection' relationships between fragments.
        \item\code{tai.fragments}: information about the fragments.
    }
}
\usage{data(Tai)}
\format{
    \itemize{
        \item\code{tai.connection} is a 279x2 matrix. Each line describes a connection relationship between two fragments. Their unique identifiers are given in column 'id1' and in column 'id2', respectively. 
        \item\code{fontjuvenal.fragments} is 815x8 data frame:
        \itemize{
            \item id:  fragment unique identifier 
            \item layer:   stratigraphic layer
            \item sector: sector of the site
            \item sherd_size: size class of the pottery sherd (nb: the numeric value is not metrical)
            \item sherd_thickness: thickness of the pottery sherd in millimeter
<<<<<<< HEAD
            \item x: x coordinates of the location where the pottery sherd was found (in centimetres)
            \item y: y coordinates of the location where the pottery sherd was found (in centimetres)
            \item z: z coordinates of the location where the pottery sherd was found (in centimetres)
