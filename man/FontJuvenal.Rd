\title{Dataset: Refitting relationships between pottery fragments from Font-Juvenal cave}
\description{
<<<<<<< HEAD
   The Font-Juvenal cave is a Neolithic archaeological site in France. This dataset describes the refitting 'connection' relationships between pottery fragments found during excavations. Connection relationship refers to physical connection between two fragments that were part of the same object.

    The dataset is composed of two tables:
    \itemize{
        \item\code{fontjuvenal.connection}: connection relationships between fragments.
        \item\code{fontjuvenal.fragments}: information about the fragments.
    }
